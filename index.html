    Transferable Discipleship is a tool for Simple, Accessible, and Transferable Christian discipleship.
    
    To grow in your faith, there is no better place to turn than allowing the Bible to work in your heart. Scripture is the
    foundation for this material.
    
    The format of this material is simple:
    
    1. Read the question.
    2. Read what the Bible says to answer the question.
    3. Discuss each question based on the Scripture given.
    
    After each passage of Scripture, some hints are given to help guide the conversation and give an idea how each verse
    helps answer the question.
