3. Navigate to the `transferable-discipleship` folder created by `git clone`
4. Run `npm install`

### Build license

Run `npm run licenses` to build the software library licenses file (displayed in the app for attribution purposes).

## To run locally

Run on your preferred platform on the same network:

- `npm start` - runs in the web browser and allows you to use the Expo Go app to test the app on Android and iOS

## Publishing

You can build, publish, and update this app using [EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/) with the following instructions.

### Publishing Environment Setup

#### Apple Environment Variables

You need to tell Expo about your [Apple credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/ios/#2-start-the-submission) in some way. One way is by setting the following environment variables:

- `EXPO_APPLE_ID` (or set it in [`eas.json`](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/json/#appleid))
- [`EXPO_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/apple-app-specific-password.md)

### Pre-build setup

There are a few things you need to do before building and publishing the app every time you build and publish.

#### Bump versions

Increase the version number in the following ways if it has not already been done since the previous release:

1. Run `npm version ${version_semver} --git-tag-version false` to change in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
2. Manually bump in `app.json` - two [semver](https://semver.org/) locations; one integer android version code (do not change this if you are just [doing an update](#publishing-updates-to-releases))
3. Manually bump in `screens.json` - one [semver](https://semver.org/) location

#### Update Scripture cache

1. [Start the application locally](#to-run-locally) in dev mode and open in the web browser.
2. Wait a bit to make sure Scripture calls have succeeded
   - If there are console errors about not retrieving all Scriptures, it may be a rate limit issue with the server. Please refresh and wait a few times to see if the Scriptures finish caching
3. Copy the local storage value `scriptureCache` and paste it into `./assets/data/scripture.json`.
4. Reload the page and make sure there are no caching messages like "Did not find \_\_\_ in cache. Caching".

#### Update software license attribution

`npm run licenses`

## Building and publishing preview builds

### Create an Android Preview `.apk` to install on your device

`npm run build:preview-android`

### Create an iOS Preview build to install on your device

Before building, you must register devices on which to use the preview build.

#### Register devices to use the iOS Preview build

https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/#setting-up-internal-distribution

`eas device:create`

#### Build the iOS Preview

`npm run build:preview-ios`

### Publishing updates to preview builds

Updates must be performed on the same version as the build you are targeting. For example, if you release build 2.1.2, updates must be done on 2.1.2. You can use 2.1.2-update-N in some contexts, but do not change the version in `app.json`.

`eas update --branch preview --message "Update message"`

### Create and serve a web preview build

```bash
npm run build:production-web
npm run preview-build:web
```

- This is currently not functional. See https://github.com/tjcouch1/transferable-discipleship/issues/24

## Building and publishing releases

### Android and iOS

https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/

Build first:

`npm run build:production-android`
`npm run build:production-ios`
`npm run build:production-all`

Then run the following commands to publish the latest build on Expo's servers:

- [`eas submit --platform ios`](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/ios/)
- [`eas submit --platform android`](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/android/)

Note: looks like you can maybe provide `--profile production` to make sure it selects the production build, but it's unclear. Needs testing.

Alternatively, you can build and submit in one step:

`eas build --auto-submit`

Note: this has not been tested. I imagine this submits android and ios in production.

Once you have submitted the build, go to the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account) and [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) to release the app.

### Publishing updates to releases

Updates must be performed on the same version as the build you are targeting. For example, if you release build 2.1.2, updates must be done on 2.1.2. You can use 2.1.2-update-N in some contexts, but do not change the version in `app.json`.

`eas update --branch production --message "vX.Y.Z-update-N Update message"`

### Web

Build first:

`npm run build:production-web`

Then commit the contents of the `dist` folder into the `app` folder of the `gh-pages` branch.

- This is currently not functional. See https://github.com/tjcouch1/transferable-discipleship/issues/24
