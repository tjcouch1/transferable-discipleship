## How to adapt this template to your own app

1. Fork this repo! https://github.com/tjcouch1/discipleship-app-template
2. Find and Replace all of the following strings with your desired information:
    - Discipleship App Template -> app name
    - discipleship-app-template -> repository name
    - <repo_url> -> repository url (ex: https://github.com/tjcouch1/discipleship-app-template)
    - <content_creator> -> content creator's name
    - <contact_email> -> preferred email address for contact about the app
3. Revise the following files to fit your application's needs:
    - `package.json`
    - `README.md`
    - `app.json`
4. Customize the icons, content data, and theme data in the `assets` folder:
    - `adaptive-icon.png` - Icon used in Android
    - `favicon.png` - Icon used in web
    - `icon.png` - Icon used in iOS
    - `splash.png` - Loading splash screen image
    - `data/screens.json` - Content for the app
      - Regarding the `Home/About` and `Home/About/Credits` screens specifically, we request that you only add to or restructure and somehow include all the content in these screens in order to credit those whose technologies went into making this template possible and to comply with licensing needs. Otherwise, you're free to modify the content as you desire!
      - To edit with type support, you can put the contents of `data/screens.json` in `src/services/ScreenService.ts` in place of `require('../../assets/data/screens.json')`. We [plan to add JSON schemas](https://github.com/tjcouch1/discipleship-app-template/issues/25) at some point.
    - `data/colors.json` - Theme colors for the app
    - `fonts` - contains fonts used in the app. Must also update in `App.tsx` and `src/components/contents/Text.tsx`
      - To ensure including the license information for each font works properly, make sure each font family has the font family name at the start of each file name, and make sure each font family has its license in the same directory with the name `<font_family>.LICENSE`
    - `images` - contains images used in the app. Must also update in `src/services/ImageService.ts`
5. Configure [EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/) to prepare for [publishing](#publishing)
    - Install EAS CLI: `npm install --global eas-cli`
    - Login to EAS with your [Expo account](https://expo.dev/): `eas login`
    - Link EAS to this project: `eas update:configure`

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install Node
2. Run `git clone <repo_url>.git` or download the repository otherwise
3. Navigate to the `discipleship-app-template` folder created by `git clone`
4. Run `npm install`

### Build license 

Run `npm run licenses` to build the software library licenses file (displayed in the app for attribution purposes).

## To run

Run on your preferred platform:

- `npm start` - runs in the web browser, and allows you to use the expo app to test the app on android and ios
- `npm run android`
- `npm run ios`
   - Note: you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
